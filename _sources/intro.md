```{tab-item} Things I learned
- In this assignment, I learned how to create a portfolio by using those toolboxes on Github.
- Also, I learned how to hide our code parts over the JupyterLab metadata cells.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- During the assignment, I think for the first time creating a portfolio was challenging for me. Especially when I got many errors I thought that I'm doing wrong things. So, it was time consuming assigment for me.
- Also, cross-reference part was a little bit confusing for me.
